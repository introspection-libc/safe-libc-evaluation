This directory contains the vulnerable code fragments that we extracted
from the original projects and a driver to trigger the bug.

Execute
```sh
./compile
```

to build the fragments with SoftBound, LLVM's AddressSanitizer, and MPX.

The executables in `bin` can be executed and should mitigate the error.
For example:

```sh
./bin/asan/lightftp-cve-2017-1000218
```
